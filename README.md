This is a Next.js starter site for the Next.js & Contentful tutorial by the Net Ninja. It is a simple recipe blog for multiple recipes using Marmite. The details of recipes as well as the images are just filler so I would not recommend using them. However, the practice from this tutorial is exactly what I needed. I followed this tutorial to gain a better understanding of Contentful and deploying using Vercel/Next.js. It was very easy to follow and gave me all the insight I needed to continue practicing these tools on my own. If you too are interested in this guide then follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

To use the starter project, run the following in a terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app [your-site-name] -e https://github.com/iamshaunjp/next-contentful/tree/lesson-1-starter-site
```
